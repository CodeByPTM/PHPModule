# Calculator App Database ER Model

The current calculator app does not use a database, but if you wanted to store calculation history, a simple ER model could look like this:

```
+-------------------+
|   Calculation     |
+-------------------+
| id (PK)           |
| num1              |
| num2              |
| operator          |
| result            |
| created_at        |
+-------------------+
```

- **Calculation**: Stores each calculation performed by the user.
- **id**: Primary key (unique identifier)
- **num1, num2**: Input numbers
- **operator**: Operation performed
- **result**: Result of the calculation
- **created_at**: Timestamp of when the calculation was made

This is a single-entity ER model suitable for a simple calculator history feature.
